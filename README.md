Don't forget a single task, and keep track of all of them. Stay on top of things with Redux todo. 

Redux todo was a simple app built to experiment with the redux toolkit, as you can tell it was a success. The app lacks a backend and tasks will be lost onRefresh,
you're welcome to fork the project and integrate a backend of your choice.

### Look and feel

## Tech stack

Redux was the whole point of the project, so I had to use it. Here's a list of what I used:

    - React
      : the base of the app
    - Redux
      : for managing state.
    - Tailwind
      : for the project's styling

  
## Features

This is a pretty simple app, but here's what you can do with it:

    - List all your tasks.
      : You can easily put together a list of all your tasks for the day and stay informed on what's vital.
    - Update task status
      : Tasks are meant to be completed, so you can update the status of each task in your list.
  
  
## Support
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This was an educational project, meant to experiment with something new.

For any support report an issue on this repository, I'll work on it and update the codebase as soon as I can.

Better yet, you could fork the project and try fixing it, if it's something you think you can mend.
